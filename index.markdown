# Hi there!

Not my dog, sadly. I'm Katherine, a junior at Harvard concentrating in computer science with a secondary in music. I'm a [Choral Fellow](https://memorialchurch.harvard.edu/choral-fellows) and member of the [Harvard University Choir](https://youtu.be/UChJl_wkHiQ). I was a software engineering intern at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) in 2018 and 2019, and I'm returning in 2020. I was a course assistant for [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/summer/2020/) in 2018.
